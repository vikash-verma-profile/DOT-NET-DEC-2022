Problem in REST API

1.fetch all data (over-fatching).
2.multiple network requests to get multiple resources
3.network requests

Why GRAPHQL

1.Strongly-typed Schema-SDL
	-Boolean,String,Int ,Float Scaler,ID
2.No over-Fatching/Under-Fatching

WHEN to use GRAPHQL

1.Apps for devices like mobile phones,Smartwatches.
2.Applications where we have nested data.
3.proxy on client side.
